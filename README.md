# Kakuro
Kakuro is a board logic game for single player. Programming language - Java.
This project was made for education purposes. 

Instruction for the player:

All you have to do is filling in blank fields with numbers between 1 and 9. 
But not in accidental order! 
Numbers in every line (vertical or horizontal) have to sum up to a number in a triangle at the beginning of the line.
If you do it - press "check" botton. Correct solution will finish the game. If you do it wrong, you can continue and change your answer.
